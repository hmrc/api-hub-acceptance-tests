      summary: NPS Interface Specification to Retrieve Employment Summary.
      description: "# Purpose\nThis API is used to retrieve an individual's employment\
        \ summary on NPS (National Insurance and PAYE Service). This endpoint requires\
        \ Mutual Authentication over TLS 1.2.<br><p>\nTo retrieve current employment\
        \ details, provide the current tax year. <p><br>\n- This allows a historical\
        \ search for an individual's employment summary records. This will return\
        \ all possible records against an individual's employment (for all employment\
        \ statuses) using a nationalInsuranceNumber or a temporaryReferenceNumber\
        \ for the provided tax year. Example URL: /nps-json-service/nps/v1/api/employment/employment-summary/AA100001/taxYear/2023\
        \ <br>\n- This is the URL used for processing of next set of records needed\
        \ via the general search against a given nationalInsuranceNumber or temporaryReferenceNumber\
        \ for an individual, using the moreDataSequenceNumber. Example URL: /nps-json-service/nps/v1/api/employment/employment-summary/AA100001/taxYear/2023?moreDataSequenceNumber=123\
        \ <br>\n- This allows a refined search for an individual's employment summary\
        \ records based on the individual's employment status. Example URL: /nps-json-service/nps/v1/api/employment/employment-summary/AA100001/taxYear/2023?employmentStatus=1\
        \ <br>\n- This is the URL used for processing of next set of individual's\
        \ employment summary records based on the individual's employment status using\
        \ the moreDataSequenceNumber. Example URL: /nps-json-service/nps/v1/api/employment/employment-summary/AA100001/taxYear/2023?employmentStatus=1&moreDataSequenceNumber=123\
        \ <br>\n# Volumes & Registered Consumers\nThis API is consumed by the following\
        \ 'Registered Consumers' who would all need to be impacted when a new consumer\
        \ with an associated new load first registers to use the service, or an uplift\
        \ is required to the API. Each 'Registered Consumer' below will receive an\
        \ additional Security Spec. document that outlines how to connect to the various\
        \ environments as well as any consumer-specific authorisation/authentication\
        \ details - this is unique to their connection.\n\n| Consumer | Average API\
