      description: |-
        # Purpose
        This API is used to retrieve tax-based account information/indicators associated with an individual in NPS (National Insurance & PAYE Service). A single record for an individual will be returned. It forms part of the Personal Details Processing. This endpoint requires Mutual Authentication over TLS 1.2.<br><p>
        # Volumes & Registered Consumers
        This API is consumed by the following 'Registered Consumers' who would all need to be impacted when a new consumer with an associated new load first registers to use the service, or an uplift is required to the API. Each 'Registered Consumer' below will receive an additional Security Spec. document that outlines how to connect to the various environments as well as any consumer-specific authorisation/authentication details - this is unique to their connection.
